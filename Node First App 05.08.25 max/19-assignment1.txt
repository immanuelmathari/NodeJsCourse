I want you to create a brand new nodejs file
1. that spins up a Node.js-driven server on port 3000
2. Handle two routes "/" and "/users"
   returns some greeting text on "/"
   returns a list of dummy users eg <ul><li>users</li></ul>
3. in the "/" after the greeting, add a form with a "username" name <input> to the "/" page and submit a POST request to "/create-user" upon a button click
4. Add the "/create-user" route and parse the incoming data (ie the username) and simply log it to the console
5.
